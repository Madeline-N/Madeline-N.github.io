        <p>As someone who has been to the spectacular province of PEI I can say in full <br> confidence it's one of the most ideal locations for your summer vacation. <br>
        PEI has plenty of wonderful things, lovely beaches, beautiful towns and tourist<br>
        sites, wildlife and nature, and fresh tasty seafood. </p>
        
        <h2>The Beaches:</h2>
        <p>PEI has many beautiful beaches. The beaches in PEI are known for their red <br>
        hue, this is due to the iron-oxidize content in the soil, which gives the beach<br>
        a unique look and looks stunning in photos! Unlike other beach locations around<br>
        the world you can find many quiet beaches and hidden gems around your area!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Here are some of the most popular beaches in PEI:</strong> <br>
